# Dino_Crypto_Algorithm

![Dino_Crypto_Algorithm](imgs/Dino_Crypto_Algorithm.png)

Welcome to **Dino_Crypto_Algorithm** ‚Äì a groundbreaking cryptographic solution that takes data security to the next level. By combining a proprietary recursive encryption mechanism with the robust AES-128 standard, this project ensures that your sensitive information remains completely protected‚Äîeven if an encrypted key is intercepted.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Dino_Crypto_Algorithm** is a state-of-the-art cryptographic engine built in C# designed for:
- **Multi-layered Security:** Recursive encryption of keys prevents unauthorized decryption even if parts of the encryption system are compromised.
- **AES-128 Integration:** Reinforces key protection by applying the well-known AES-128 standard as an additional security layer.
- **Complete Data Protection:** Both your data and encryption keys are encrypted with advanced techniques, ensuring unmatched confidentiality.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Ideal for both desktop and web applications, offering seamless integration with a wide range of systems.

---

## üåü Key Features

- **Secure Key Encryption:**  
  The encryption key is initially obfuscated using an internal mechanism and then secured with AES-128, ensuring that it remains indecipherable to unauthorized users.

- **Recursive Encryption Mechanism:**  
  Data undergoes multiple layers of encryption, making brute-force and analytical attacks virtually impossible.

- **Robust AES-128 Encryption:**  
  Enhances security by applying a widely trusted encryption standard that balances speed and protection.

- **User-Friendly CLI:**  
  Easily encrypt and decrypt text, files, or entire directories through a versatile command-line interface.

- **High Compatibility:**  
  Designed in C#, this algorithm can be integrated into various applications with minimal effort.

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 5.0 (or later)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- A C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code)

### Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Natiqmammad/Dino_Crypto_Algorithm.git
cd Dino_Crypto_Algorithm
```

### Build the Project
Open the project in your preferred IDE or run:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

**Dino_Crypto_Algorithm** provides a powerful command-line interface (CLI) for various encryption and decryption operations. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

### Encrypt Text
```bash
./DinoCrypto.exe --txt "Hello, World!"
```
- **`--txt`**: Encrypts the provided text string.
- The program outputs the encrypted text along with the encryption key.

### Decrypt Text
```bash
./DinoCrypto.exe -d --txt "YourEncryptedTextHere"
```
- **`-d`**: Switches the program to decryption mode.
- **`--txt`**: Decrypts the provided text.

### Encrypt a Directory
```bash
./DinoCrypto.exe --D "/path/to/your/directory"
```
- **`--D`**: Encrypts all files and subdirectories within the specified directory, including file names.

### Decrypt a Directory
```bash
./DinoCrypto.exe -d --D "/path/to/your/directory"
```
- Decrypts the contents and the names of files within the directory.

### Specify a Custom Encryption Key
```bash
./DinoCrypto.exe -K "YourEncryptedKey" --txt "SampleText"
```
- **`-K`**: Uses a user-specified encryption key (secured via AES-128) for the operation.

### Additional Commands
- **`--Win32`**: Applies Windows-compatible encryption for file and directory names.
- **`--aes`**: Adds an extra layer of AES encryption.
- **`-P`**: Enables Private Mode to suppress verbose logging.
- **`-R`**: Restricts the operation to renaming files/folders without modifying content.

For a complete list of commands, simply run:

```bash
./DinoCrypto.exe --help
```

## üèó Project Architecture

**Dino_Crypto_Algorithm** is modularly designed for clarity, maintainability, and scalability:

- **Core Modules:**
  - **DinoCipher.cs:** Contains the core recursive encryption and decryption logic.
  - **AesCipher.cs:** Implements AES-128 encryption/decryption methods to secure keys and data.
  - **KeyManager.cs:** Manages key generation, storage, and retrieval processes.

- **File Handling Modules:**
  - **FileEncryptor.cs:** Responsible for encrypting/decrypting the contents of files.
  - **DirectoryEncryptor.cs:** Manages encryption/decryption of file and folder names recursively.

- **CLI Modules:**
  - **CommandParser.cs:** Parses command-line arguments and directs operations.
  - **UserInterface.cs:** Provides an interactive user experience for encryption/decryption tasks.

This design ensures each component has a single responsibility, making the system robust and easily extendable.
